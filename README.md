[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=102)](https://github.com/command-z3r0?tab=repositories)

The Kali Linux Key Fixer is a simple script designed to address the issue of invalid signatures when updating Kali Linux repositories.

## Problem

When updating Kali Linux repositories using the `apt-get update` command, you might encounter the error message: "The following signatures were invalid: EXPKEYSIG ED444FF07D8D0BF6 Kali Linux Repository."

This error occurs due to outdated or invalid GPG keys used to verify the integrity of the packages.

## Solution

This script automates the process of resolving the invalid signature error by updating the GPG keys and adjusting the repository URLs. It performs the following steps:

1. Downloads the necessary key file.
2. Installs the key file using the `apt` package manager.
3. Removes the downloaded key file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/commander-Z3R0/keyfixer.git
   cd keyfixer
   chmod +x keyfixer.sh
   ./keyfixer.sh
   ```
