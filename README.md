The Kali Linux Key Fixer is a simple script designed to address the issue of invalid signatures when updating Kali Linux repositories.

## Problem

When updating Kali Linux repositories using the `apt-get update` command, you might encounter the error message: "The following signatures were invalid: EXPKEYSIG ED444FF07D8D0BF6 Kali Linux Repository."

1. Downloads the necessary key file.
2. Installs the key file using the `apt` package manager.
3. Removes the downloaded key file.
